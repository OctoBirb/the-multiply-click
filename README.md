# Exponential Madness REBIRTH
This is the revised version of the game that I made, but then broke with a number engine.
<br>
This time though, I know how to use number engines, and this time I'm also going to use a number engine that doesn't have numbers I can't get to, yet.
<br>
## Alpha
Alpha 1.0.0 - Initial game released, used break_infinity.js
<br>
Alpha 1.0.1 - The various changes of trying to fix x.00000000000001
<br>
Alpha 1.0.2 - Changed the engine to break_eternity.js
<br>
Alpha 1.1.0 - Added an endgame and a few different update texts for the various levels of numbers (e.g. 1, e6, ee4)
<br>
Alpha 1.1.1 - Tweaked when the first "e" shows - from 1e19 to 1e10, i think
<br>
**Alpha 1.2.0 - First button!**
